# North_South_Assymetry

There isn't much to say to properly explain this repo. It contains the code to find the NSA of any given cassini dataset, and store the NSA, flux, and deviation of NSA for all images stored within the datset.

There are also many different plotting tools that were created for this repo, each with their own visualziations, and different implemenations. The newest functions it the one you are likely looking for.

The datasets analyzed by the paper are all contained within the repo, as well as the csv containing their latitude and longitudes.
